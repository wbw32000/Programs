Review

1) What is the basic syntax of a user-defined function?
 1A:The basic syntax of a user-defined function is: 
  1. The keyword 'function'.
  2. The name of the function, without spaces.
  3. Within parentheses, the function arguments.
  4. Within curly braces, the statements in the body of the function.

2) What naming rules must your own functions abide by?
 2A: In its definition, a function name must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores, and no spaces.

3) What naming rules must function arguments abide by?
 Defined function arguments are in the form of a list, which is a comma-delimited list of expressions.
 3A: Each argument, evaluated from left to right, is a variable, which is defined using the same naming rules as any other variable in PHP.
 If the argument passes by value, it starts with a dollar sign($). e.g. $my_string
 If the argument passes by reference, it starts with an ampersand (&) and a dollar sign($). e.g. &$my_string

4) How do you provide a default value for a functions argument?
 4A: We can provide a default value for a function argument by assigning a value to the argument in the function definition. e.g. function say_hi($arg1=`there')

5) In the example code in the Understanding Variable Scope section of the chapter, why does the code use \$n? What would happen if that backslash wasn t there?
 5A: The code uses \$n to print, at the start of the printed statement, the name of the variable and not the value of the variable. If that backslash wasn t there, the value of the variable would be printed at the start of the printed statement.

6) What is variable scope? What scope does a function argument variable have?
 6A: The scope of a variable is the realm in which it exists. e.g.
 - Variables in a script exist for the life of that script. i.e. single scope.
 - Environment variables, like $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], exist throughout every PHP script on the server. 
 - Function variables (the arguments of a function and variables defined within the function), are local variables with local scope, and exist only within that function and aren’t accessible outside of the function.
 - Global variables, made by global statements, turn local variables with local scope into global variables with global scope.
 - Superglobal array variables ($_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, and $_SESSION) have the added benefit that they’re always available inside functions without requiring the global statement within a script.

7) What scope does a variable in an included file have? Note: This is a tricky one!
 7A: A variable in an included file has a single scope. i.e. Like a variable in a script, it exists for the life of that script.

1.1 Make the function in menus.php take arguments to indicate the starting year and the number of years to generate. 
1.2 Make the later argument have a default value. OK.
1.3 Then rewrite the function body so that it uses these values in the year for loop. OK.

2. Rewrite the make_text_input() function so that it can be told whether to look for an existing value in either $_POST or $_GET. OK.
 http://www./eclectichub.info/PHP/Ch10/ch10Psticky1.php 

3. Create a variation on the make_text_input() function that can create a text input or a password input, depending upon how the function is called. OK.
 http://www./eclectichub.info/PHP/Ch10/ch10Psticky2.php 

4. Come up with an idea for, create, and use your own custom function.
 Function to convert between metric and imperial weight units. OK.
