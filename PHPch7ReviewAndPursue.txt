PHP for the Web - Chapter 7: Using Arrays - Review and Pursue

If you have any problems with the review questions or the pursue prompts, turn to the books supporting forum (www.LarryUllman.com/forum/).

Review
Q1) Whats the difference between an indexed array and an associative array? 
A1: An indexed array has numbers as keys; an associative array (aka a hash) has strings as keys.

Q2) When should you use quotation marks for an array's key or value? When shouldnt you?
A2: We would use quotation marks for an array's keys or values when the keys or values are strings.
    We wouldn't use quotation marks for an array's keys or values when the keys or values are numbers.

Q3) How do you print a specific array element? How do you print every element in an array?
A3: We would print a specific array element by printing the array name while referring to the array element's index in brackets. e.g. $arrayname[0].
    We would print every element in an array by using:
   1. the function print_r($arrayname),
   2. a foreach() loop in assigning the current array element's key to a $key (or $k) variable, and, with an equal-greater-than symbol (=>) the value to $value (or $v).
      e.g. foreach ($array as $key => $value) { print "<p>Key is $key. Value is $value</p>";}
   3. the var_dump() function, which would also show the array's structure in a more detailed format.

Q4) What happens if you dont use the square brackets when adding an element to an array?
A4: If we don't use the square brackets when adding an element to an array, the new value (a string or number), will replace the existing array.

Q5) What function returns the number of elements in an array?
A5: To return the number of elements in an array,  we can use sizeof() or count().

Q6) When must you use curly brackets for printing array elements?
Q7) What is the difference between the sort() and asort() functions? Between sort() and rsort()?
Q8) What is the syntax for explode()? For implode()? If you dont remember, check out the PHP manual page for either function.

Pursue
1) Check out the PHP manuals pages for the array-related functions.
  Look into some of the other available array functions.
  In particular Id recommend familiarizing yourself with array_key_exists(), array_search(), and in_array().
2) Rewrite soups2.php so that it displays the number of elements in the array without using a separate variable.
  Hint: Youll need to concatenate the count() function call into the print statement.
3) Create another script that creates and displays a multidimensional array (or some of it, anyway).
4) Rewrite list.php so that it uses foreach instead of implode(), but still prints each sorted word on its own line in the browser.
  Also add some form validation so that it only attempts to parse and sort the string if it has a value.
