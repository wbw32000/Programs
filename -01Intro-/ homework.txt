If you can see this locally, you have completed half the homework so far.
If you like, you can go to
https://badges-dev.allizom.org/en-US/
to claim your badge for successfully checking out the github repository.

You will have to set up a BrowserID account if you want to claim your badge.
Getting badges is not necessary to complete MySQL Marinate, but it is fun!
The meetup group and organizers will never see your e-mail address, and
BrowserID is being used increasingly for logins on the web.

Once you are logged in, you can use claim code to claim your badge:
