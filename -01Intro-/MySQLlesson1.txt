Learning MySQL - Part II - Using MySQL - Exercises

Exercises
1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?
 1A: From chapter 3. It means clients connect to the server to perform database operations such as reading or storing data.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We’ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using the monitor in batch mode?
 3A: In interactive mode, we enter SQL queries or MySQL commands such as SHOW DATABASES at the MySQL prompt, and see the results.
 In batch mode, we tell the monitor to read in and execute a list of commands (sequence of operations) from a saved file.
 This is useful when you need to run a large set of operations—for example, when you want to restore a database from a backup file.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
 4A0: The options can be specified on the command line or in the [mysql] and [client] groups of an option file...
 4A1: The user option provides the MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
   It assigns ownership of the MySQL datafiles and folders to the specified user. e.g.
   $ sudo scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql 
 4A2: The password option gets the password of the user to use when connecting to the server. e.g.
   $ mysql --user=the_username 
 4A3: The database option sets the database to use.
